                <p class="text">I have been working in software development for 3 years.
                    Initially, in 2015, I founded a digital tech start-up, Unity-Hub.
                    The aim of the company was to develop a Web App that makes business meetings more productive.
                    I secured equity investment from Webstart Bristol to develop my idea and earned a place in
                    the first Entrepreneurial Spark incubator in Bristol. After receiving the investment I
                    outsourced design and development work in order to prove concept and raise more investment.
                    Employing the services of a front-end developer - and working alongside them - gave me a
                    fantastic insight into coding and beyond, such as user-profiling and agile methodology.
                    As a non-technical director during this time, I became fascinated with the software
                    development side of the project; I love finding solutions to problems.
                    Ultimately, I decided to learn how to build software to ‘scratch my own itch’.

                <button class="mainButton">my skills</button>
                <p class="text">I enrolled on the Mayden Academy software development programme in February 2018.
                    This began a four month intensive course of advanced software development, including: HTML, CSS,
                    CSM, SQL, JS, MVC & PHP, Node.js and Zend.

                <p class="text">I am a very proud husband and father of a one year-old baby boy, Joshua! We live in Keynsham
                    in the first house we have ever owned. My wife, Hannah, and I met in Mexico in 2003 while we were
                    volunteering for a charity organisation. My wife is originally from Bristol area whereas I was
                    born and raised on the Merseyside. I enjoy keeping myself fit and active; I currently play
                    for Keynsham Hockey Club.
                    We are blessed with many great friends and family whom we share time with regularly.

                <p class="text">I helped to continue the build for an online quiz application for users to register
                    and take an academy aptitude test. As a team, we refactored an existing code base, including
                    bug fixes. Specifically, I worked on creating a new link between the admin page and the API
                    so that the course administrators could easily view, edit and delete participants' data.
                    For this project, I worked mainly in PHP.

                <p class="text">I helped to build an ecommerce clothes store. As a team, we built a suite of products
                    arranged by category and able to be viewed by the user with details of title, image, prize, size,
                    colour and description.
                    For this project, I worked mainly in OOP PHP and used autoloading with namespacing.

                <p class="text">I helped to build an interactive game. As a team, we designed, coded and delivered
                    a racing-themed game for two players using keyboard controls. Specifically, I worked
                    on designing the first of two tracks and creating an ajax request that allows users to
                    view either race track before starting the game.
                    For this project, I worked mainly in JavaScript and JQuery.
