                    <p>I have been working in software development for 3 years.
                    Initially, in 2015, I founded a digital tech start-up, Unity-Hub.
                    The aim of the company was to develop a Web App that makes business meetings more productive.
                    I secured equity investment from <a href="http://www.webstartbristol.com/">Webstart Bristol</a> to develop my idea and earned a place in
                    the first <a href="https://www.entrepreneurial-spark.com/">Entrepreneurial Spark</a> incubator in Bristol. After receiving the investment I
                    outsourced design and development work in order to prove concept and raise more investment.
                    Employing the services of a front-end developer - and working alongside them - gave me a
                    fantastic insight into coding and beyond, such as user-profiling and agile methodology.
                    As a non-technical director during this time, I became fascinated with the software
                    development side of the project; I love finding solutions to problems.
                    Ultimately, I decided to learn how to build software to ‘scratch my own itch’.

                    <p>I am a very proud husband and father to a one year-old baby boy, Joshua! We are blessed with
                        many great friends and family. I enjoy keeping
                        myself fit and active; I currently play for Keynsham Hockey Club.

                        <p>I helped to continue the build for an online quiz application for users to register
                            and take an academy aptitude test. As a team, we refactored an existing code base, including
                            bug fixes. Specifically, I worked on creating a new link between the admin page and the API
                            so that the course administrators could easily view, edit and delete participants' data.
                            For this project, I worked mainly in JavaScript but also refactored PHP.

                        <p>I have also built an ecommerce clothes store. As a team, we built a suite of products
                            arranged by category and able to be viewed by the user with details of title, image, prize, size,
                            colour and description.
                            For this project, I worked mainly in object-oriented PHP.

                        <p>I worked as part of a team to build an interactive game. We designed, coded and delivered
                            a racing-themed game for two players using keyboard controls. Personally, I worked
                            on designing the first of two tracks and creating an ajax request that allows users to
                            view either race track before starting the game.
                            For this project, I worked mainly in JavaScript and JQuery.

                        <p>I designed and developed the concept of Unity-Hub, a Web App aims to make business meetings
                            matter. Unity-Hub is the result of Productive Meetings; a digital tech start-up I founded
                            in 2015.
